ðŸ¦œ LangChain: Summarize Text From YouTube or Websites
Overview
Welcome to the LangChain Summarizer! This Streamlit app leverages cutting-edge language models and AI-powered embedding techniques to provide concise summaries of content from YouTube videos or websites. Using a combination of the Groq Gemma-7b-It model and OpenAI embeddings, this tool allows users to extract key insights from long-form content without reading or watching everything themselves.

The summarizer uses a smart pipeline that:

Loads content from a YouTube video or webpage.
Breaks the text into manageable chunks.
Embeds the content for efficient retrieval of key information.
Summarizes the most relevant sections using AI, providing a quick overview.
Features
Summarize YouTube Videos: Input any YouTube URL and get a concise summary of the video's content.
Summarize Web Pages: Provide a web page URL, and the app will summarize the text from the site.
AI-Powered: Uses Groq's Gemma-7b-It model for generating summaries and OpenAI embeddings for text understanding and retrieval.
Automatic Text Splitting: Handles long content by splitting it into smaller chunks before processing, making sure no important details are missed.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit, making it easy to use without any technical setup.
Installation and Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/STAVAN-2710/YT-Website-Content-Summarizer.git
cd YT-Website-Content-Summarizer
2. Install Dependencies
You can install the required dependencies using pip. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up API Keys
To use the app, you'll need API keys for both Groq and OpenAI. Get your API keys and keep them handy.

4. Run the App
